## Pre-Installation Setup

### Enable Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

#### For Intel Processors (VT-x)
1. **Restart** your computer and enter BIOS/UEFI setup (usually F2, F12, or DEL key)
2. **Navigate** to Advanced Settings or CPU Configuration
3. **Look for** "Intel VT-x" or "Intel Virtualization Technology"
4. **Enable** the setting
5. **Save and Exit** BIOS/UEFI

#### For AMD Processors (AMD-V)
1. **Restart** your computer and enter BIOS/UEFI setup
2. **Navigate** to Advanced Settings or CPU Configuration
3. **Look for** "AMD-V" or "SVM Mode"
4. **Enable** the setting
5. **Save and Exit** BIOS/UEFI

### Verify Virtualization Support

#### Windows
```cmd
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator
systeminfo | findstr /i "Hyper-V"

# Or use PowerShell
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Check for virtualization support
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

# If result is 1 or higher, virtualization is supported
# Check if KVM modules are loaded
lsmod | grep kvm

# Install CPU checker (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install cpu-checker
kvm-ok
```

#### macOS
```bash

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Problems
```bash
# Symptoms: Slow VM performance
# Solutions:
1. Increase allocated RAM
2. Enable hardware acceleration
3. Use SSD storage
4. Close unnecessary host applications
5. Disable antivirus real-time scanning for VM folder
```

### Network Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Symptoms: No network access in VM
# Solutions:
1. Check adapter settings (NAT/Bridged/Host-Only)
2. Restart network service in guest OS
3. Check firewall settings
4. Reinstall Guest Additions
5. Reset network settings in VirtualBox

# Linux network restart:
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### Guest Additions Installation Failures
```bash
# Symptoms: Cannot install Guest Additions
# Solutions:
1. Update guest OS first
2. Install kernel headers and development tools

# For Kali Linux:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms build-essential

# Then reinstall Guest Additions
```

## Security Best Practices

### VM Isolation
- **Never** expose vulnerable VMs to the internet
- **Use** isolated networks for testing
- **Take** snapshots before and after testing
- **Encrypt** VM files if storing sensitive data

### Snapshot Management
```bash
# Taking Snapshots
Right-click VM > Snapshots > Take Snapshot
Name: "Clean Kali Installation"
Description: "Fresh Kali install with Guest Additions"

# Restoring Snapshots
Select snapshot > Restore
# Note: This will lose current state unless you take another snapshot first
```

### Backup and Recovery
```bash
# Regular backups
# Export VMs for backup
File > Export Appliance
# Choose VMs to export
# Select OVF format for compatibility
```
