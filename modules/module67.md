CHAPTER 2
Hacking Environment
The very first thing that you need is a virtual machine. As I said before, I have Ubuntu as
my default operating system and inside my virtual machine I have installed two operating
systems—one is Windows XP and the other is Kali Linux.
Technically, from now on I would mention Windows XP and Kali Linux as my virtual
machines. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution that comes up with many useful hacking
tools. So I strongly suggest using it as your virtual machine. You may also read the
documentation page of Kali Linux, which will also be an immense help.
At the same time, I’d not suggest using Windows of any kind for the ethical hacking
purpose. Some may argue that few hacking tools can be used in Windows, so why you
are suggesting otherwise? The point is: in the ethical hacking world, you need to be
anonymous all the time. You won’t want to keep your trail, anyway, so that you can be
traced back. Remaining anonymous is a big challenge. In Linux it is fairly easy and you
can stay anonymous for the time being.
Keeping that in mind, I explain that technique of being anonymous in great detail
so that before jumping up into the big task, you make your defense much stronger. Being
anonymous is the most important thing in the world of ethical hacking. Keeping yourself
anonymous in Windows is not possible. So it is better to adapt to the Linux environment
first. Another important thing is, most of the great hacking tools are not available in the
Windows environment.
If you have never heard of any Linux distribution, don’t worry. You can either install
user-friendly Ubuntu inside your Windows system or you can easily partition your disk
into two parts and install Ubuntu and Windows separately as your two default operating
systems. It is preferable to do the latter. Installing and uninstalling parallel operating
systems always teaches you something new. If you are familiar with Windows, I won’t tell
you to simply dump it for the sake of learning ethical hacking. You can keep it and use it
for your daily work. There is no problem in doing this.
In the Internet world, Linux is used more. So you need to learn a few Linux commands.
Software installation in Linux is slightly different from Windows environments. There
are Linux distributions like Fedora or Debian, and many more. I named Ubuntu just
because it is extremely popular and Windows users find themselves comfortable inside
it. The operations are more or less the same, including the software installations. For
beginners, it is not a good idea to install Kali Linux as your default OS. You must read Kali
documentation, where it is clearly stated that Kali is more for developers. You are going to
install it inside your Virtual Box. Kali Linux is a kind of Linux distribution that comes with
lot of hacking tools. You need to know them and use them in the course of ethical hacking.
