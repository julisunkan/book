Chapter 2 ■ Hacking Environment
Installing Virtual Machine is a very important step as the first step of building
your environment. In the next chapter I will show you how you can do that for different
operating systems. Another important thing is learning a programming language that will
really help you learn ethical hacking better.
The obvious choice is Python. At the time of writing this book, Python 3.x has already
arrived and is considered the future of this language. It is very quickly catching up with
the old Python 2.x version, which has been around the market for a while. The official
Python download page provides the repository of Python installers for Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux operating systems. If you download an installer, it is of immense help
because it comes with the Python interpreter, standard library, and standard modules.
The standard library and built-in modules are specifically very important because they
offer you several useful capabilities that will help you achieve your goal as an ethical
hacker. Among the useful modules, you will get cryptographic services, Internet data
handling, interaction with IP protocols, interoperability with the operating system,
and many more. So go ahead, pick up any good beginner’s book on Python, read the
official documentation and know that it is a part of your learning schedule. Python is an
extremely easy language to learn.
To create an ideal ethical hacker’s environment, a few steps are extremely important.
The steps include: installing Virtual Machine or Virtual Box (VB), having a basic
knowledge about networking, and learning a useful programming language like Python.
Let us first have a look at the basic networking knowledge.
Ethical Hacking and Networking
A basic knowledge about internetworking is extremely important if you want to learn
ethical hacking. As you progress and want to go deeper, it is advisable to learn more about
networking. Ethical hacking and internetworking are very closely associated. As you
progress through this book you will find words like “packet,” “switch,” “router,” “modem,”
“TCP/IP,” “OSI,” and many more.
The very first thing you need to know is: data travels through many layers. Ethical
hackers try to understand these layers. Once they have understood the movement, they
either want to track and block the data or they want to retrieve data.
In this chapter, we will very briefly see how internetworking models work. We will
look into the different types of networking models. We will also learn about the devices
that comprise a network.
What Does Network Mean?
A network is a collection of devices that are connected through media. One of the main
characteristics of a network is: devices contain services and resources. Devices contain
personal computers, switches, routers, and servers, among others. What do they do
basically? They send data and get data either by switching or by routing. Actually, they
connect users so that users ultimately get full data instead of getting it by pieces. So the
basic services these devices provide include switching, routing, addressing, and data
access.
